        <h1>Call for Papers: Recently Published Research Track</h1>

        <p>The <strong>KR 2025 Recently Published Research Track</strong> provides a forum to discuss recent research on KR-related topics that may not be easily accessible to the KR community. It invites submissions of extended abstracts of papers that have appeared or been accepted for publication in journals or conference proceedings.</p>

        <p>Accepted papers to the track will be linked from the conference web site. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference to present the work.</p>

        <h2>Expected Contributions</h2>

        <p>Submissions should meet the following criteria:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Papers must have been published in a journal or conference proceedings (except KR) in 2023 or later.</li>
          <li>Papers that are in press may be submitted as long as the final camera-ready version is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They should also fall into one or both of the following categories:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Papers that
            <ul>
              <li>bridge KR to other areas of AI, computer science, or to other disciplines for which an interface with KR exists (this includes database theory, game theory, social choice, logic and philosophy, etc);</li>
              <li>bridge KR to areas that make use of KR, such as multi-agent systems, planning, natural language understanding, machine learning, explainable AI;</li>
              <li>go beyond the commonly-understood boundaries of KR.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Papers that are tightly related to KR and
            <ul>
              <li>have been published in journals but have not been presented at workshops or conferences;</li>
              <li>have been presented at conferences that are not typically attended by the KR community;</li>
              <li>have been accepted at general high-profile AI conferences such as IJCAI, ECAI, or AAAI, where the time allotted has not allowed for a full discussion of all key aspects of the paper.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>

        <p>The deadlines are AoE - Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Submission deadline:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="July 15, 2025">July 15, 2025</span></li>
          <li><strong>Notification of acceptance:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="August 12, 2025">August 12, 2025</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission Details</h2>

        <p>Every submission should contain:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A cover page</strong> (single page) listing the title, the authors, a complete reference to the original paper, an accessible URL from which the paper can be downloaded, and a list of keywords. The cover page must also contain a statement that the work the submission is based on has not been already presented to a KR audience in a major forum.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A two-page extended abstract</strong> of the paper following the format for regular paper KR 2025 submissions <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">using the following style files</a>. The extended abstract should present the main contributions of the paper, discuss the relevance of the paper to KR, and explain the significance of the results.
          </li>
        </ul>
