        <h1>KR Early Career Award: Call for Nominations</h1>

        <p>Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Incorporated (KR Inc.) has established a KR Early Career Award to recognize early career researchers who have already made significant research contributions to the theory and/or practice of knowledge representation and reasoning and who demonstrate great promise for future impactful contributions.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>

        <p>This award is for researchers having recently obtained their doctoral degrees. To be eligible for the 2025 Early Career Award, researchers should have completed their PhD degree in 2023 or 2024. Exceptions to this rule may however be granted in case of career interruptions (parental or family leave, long illness, etc.) or other compelling circumstances.</p>

        <p>In order not to disadvantage early-career researchers, nominations of researchers having a close connection with a member of the Awards committee will be considered, in which case, appropriate procedures for handling such Conflicts of Interest will be put in place.</p>

        <p>Note that it is not a requirement that the early-career researcher has published at the KR conference, but the relevance of their research to KRR in a broad sense (including implementation and applications of KRR techniques) should be evident.</p>

        <h2>Content of Nominations</h2>

        <p>To avoid duplicate nominations, nominators should inform the early-career researcher of their intent to submit a nomination, and there should be a single nomination for each early-career researcher.</p>

        <p>Nominations should consist of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A letter of support (1-3 pages) from the nominator(s) that provides evidence as to the significance and impact of the nominee's research contributions and their future potential. Impact should be understood broadly, e.g. impact to academia, industry, and/or society.</li>
          <li>CV of the nominee, including education and employment history, teaching, service to the research community, and any elements of community recognition. The CV should contain a full list of publications and other research productions.</li>
          <li>Career interruptions or other personal circumstances relevant for fairly assessing the nominee's contributions and potential should also be mentioned in the CV and/or nomination letter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Submit Nominations</h2>

        <p>Nominations should be submitted via EasyChair (select the "KR Early Career Award" track): <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=kr2025">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=kr2025</a></p>

        <p>A single PDF file (.pdf) should be uploaded consisting of the letter of support and CV. The name of the candidate should be put in the Title field, and the email address, affiliation, and PhD defense date of the candidate should be listed in the Abstract box. Any text can be added to the Keywords box.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you wish to nominate an early-career researcher having a close relationship with a member of this year's KR Awards Committee, please submit your nomination by email to a committee member not having a conflict with the nominee and/or to the KR Inc. President (Gabriele Kern-Isberner).</p>

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nomination deadline:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="April 30, 2025">April 30, 2025 (AoE time)</span></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The official announcement will be made at KR 2025</p>
