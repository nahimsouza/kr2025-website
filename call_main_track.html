        <h1>Call for Papers: Main Track</h1>

        <p>We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.</p>

        <h2>Submission Guidelines for the Main Track</h2>

        <p>Submissions should be <strong>anonymous</strong> and will be subject to <strong>double-blind peer review</strong>. Anonymity aims to enable reviewers to form an initial, unbiased assessment of the paper &mdash; not to prevent them from identifying the authors if they actively seek to do so. <strong>Anonymity should never come at the expense of the paper's quality, hinder the review process, or obstruct the communication of innovative ideas</strong>. For instance, authors should not exclude key references to their previous work, only avoid using I/we and my/our when referring to them. Authors are also encouraged to share and discuss their work as usual, including posting drafts online (e.g., on ArXiv).</p>

        <p>Contributions may be <strong>regular papers (up to 9 pages)</strong> or <strong>short papers (up to 4 pages)</strong>, including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted using the <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">provided style files</a>. The PDF file should be submitted through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025</a>.</p>

        <p>Authors of papers <strong>may submit a separate PDF or ZIP file with additional information</strong> supporting their claims (such as proof details, additional experimental results, further details on experimental design, etc). The ZIP file may include content such as PDFs, code, or data. Such supplementary material should be submitted via the conference management system. <strong>The paper must be self contained, as the supplementary material will not be published</strong>. Reviewers will have the option, but not the obligation, to consult the supplementary material.</p>

        <p>Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. <strong>At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work</strong>.</p>

        <p>Top papers from KR 2025 will be invited to the award-winning paper tracks of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AIJ)</strong> and the <strong>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)</strong>. Thus, award winners will have the possibility of choosing between AIJ and JAIR.</p>

        <p>All submissions will be treated confidentially until the publication date.</p>
