        <h1>Call For Papers: Main Track</h1>

        <p>
            Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of knowledge that would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics, and natural language processing, and to fields beyond AI, including data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering, computational biology, and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and practice of the representation and computational management of knowledge.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            KR 2025 will include special thematic tracks and a Recently Published Research Track, tutorials, workshops, and a Doctoral Consortium. Details about all these events and the corresponding calls will be on the website in due time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.
        </p>

        <h2>Submission Guidelines for the Main Track</h2>
        
        <p>
            Submissions should be anonymous and will be subject to double-blind peer review. Contributions may be regular papers (up to 9 pages) or short papers (up to 4 pages), including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">using the style files provided here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Top papers from KR 2025 will be invited to the award-winning paper tracks of <em>Artificial Intelligence (AIJ)</em> and the <em>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)</em>. Thus, award 
            winners will have the possibility of choosing between AIJ and JAIR.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All submissions will be treated confidentially until the publication date.
            Further details about the submission guidelines and the selection criteria will be on the website in due time.
