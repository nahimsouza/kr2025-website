        <h1>Doctoral Consortium: Call for Applications</h1>

        <p>The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2025) invites PhD students to apply for the <strong>Doctoral Consortium program</strong>.</p>

        <p>Several <strong>scholarships will be available</strong>. Information about scholarships will be <strong>announced at a later time</strong> at the KR 2025 webpage.</p>

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Applications deadline:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="July 27, 2025">July 27, 2025 (Sunday, AoE)</span></li>
          <li><strong>Acceptance notification:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="August 25, 2025">August 25, 2025 (Monday, AoE)</span></li>
          <li><strong>Conference dates:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="November 17, 2025">November 11-17, 2025</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Aims and Scope</h2>

        <p>The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a <strong>student mentoring program</strong> bringing together PhD students and senior researchers from the area of KR. The aims of the consortium are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>to provide a forum <strong>for students to present their current research</strong>, and <strong>receive feedback</strong> from other students and senior researchers;</li>
          <li>to <strong>promote contacts</strong> among PhD students working in similar areas;</li>
          <li>to <strong>support students with information and advice</strong> on academic, research, and industrial careers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The DC is intended for <strong>PhD students</strong> who have a specific research proposal and some preliminary results, but who have sufficient time prior to completing their dissertation to benefit from the consortium experience. Preference will be given to students satisfying these criteria, but we also encourage students to apply who are at an earlier or more advanced stage of the completion of their thesis. Accepted students will participate in <strong>several dedicated DC events</strong>, which will likely consist of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a lightning talk session,</li>
          <li>a poster session, where students present their posters, and</li>
          <li>a mentoring session.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <strong>precise format of the DC will be finalized closer to the conference</strong>. Each student will be given ample time to present their work and therefore be able to fully benefit from direct feedback from the assigned senior researcher mentor and the wider KR conference audience.</p>

        <h2>Application Submission</h2>

        <p>Applications must be submitted through the EasyChair system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025</a></p>

        <p>Each application must contain the following elements combined into a single PDF document:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>DC paper.</strong> A description of a problem being addressed, your motivation for addressing the problem, proposed plan of research, the progress to date (what you have already achieved and what remains to be done), and related work. It is up to the student which of these points is emphasised most. The <strong>maximum number of pages is four</strong> (bibliography included), and the same style as for KR paper submissions should be used (<a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">see here</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Curriculum Vitae.</strong> A description of your background and relevant experience (research, education, employment), maximum two pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brief letter of recommendation.</strong> A brief letter from your thesis advisor that states that they support your participation in the DC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Optionally, a suggestion of some potential mentors with similar research interests</strong>, who could give good advice on technical aspects related to the work, and/or career opportunities. For inspiration who to name, you can refer to program committee members of previous KR conferences.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The selection process will consider the quality of the submitted proposal. By default, proposals of the selected students will be made available to the public. Every student may decide that their paper will not be made public by explicitly indicating this to the DC chairs. This is mainly to enable doctoral students to submit previously published or recently submitted works and to encourage them to submit papers to KR 2025 and associated conferences and workshops.
        </p>
