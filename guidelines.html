      <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
      <p>
        We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage "reports from the field" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests. Further details about the submission guidelines and the selection criteria will be on the website in due time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributions may be regular papers (up to 9 pages) or short papers (up to 4 pages), including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted using the style files provided in the submission page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top papers from KR 2025 will be invited to the award-winning paper tracks of Artificial Intelligence (AIJ) and of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR). Thus, award winners will have the possibility of choosing between AIJ and JAIR.
      </p>
      <p>
        All submissions will be treated confidentially until the publication date.
