# KR2025 Website

This is the repository for the [KR2025 Website](https://kr.org/KR2025/). The project was based on the [Conference Website Template](https://github.com/nahimsouza/conference-website). Please refer to the original repository for more details.

## For Developers

This template is built with simplicity in mind, the pages were built just with HTML, CSS (Flexbox) and a few lines of JavaScript. 

* Header and footer sections are managed on [scripts.js](scripts.js) to avoid duplicating code across HTML files (not the perfect solution, but it gets the job done!).

* To create a new page, just copy [template.html](template.html). It comes with the header and footer already in place, so you only need to fill in the main section.
