        <h1>Call for Papers: KR and Constraints</h1>
      
        <p>As a complement to the traditional KR Main track, the <strong>KR and Constraints</strong> track aims to showcase successful integrations between KR and Constraints techniques (CP, SAT, ASP, MILP,...).</p>
      
        <p>Towards these goals, the KR and Constraints Track welcomes contributions from areas that are sometimes considered as not core KR research. This includes (but is not restricted to) the use of constraint techniques to help solve KR-specific problems or the application of KR techniques to aid the solving of constraint-specific problems. As further goals, the track aims to <strong>foster interactions between members of the two communities</strong>, encourage discussion of new ideas, research experiences, emerging results, and open challenges that can inspire novel research directions and influence the future of KR research.</p>
      
        <h2>Expected Contributions</h2>
        <p>We invite submissions of papers on all aspects integrating constraints and KR techniques, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Constraint modeling and solving of KR problems</li>
          <li>Use of KR techniques to enhance constraint solving</li>
          <li>Integration of constraint techniques into KR tools</li>
          <li>Theoretical contributions at the intersection between KR and constraints</li>
          <li>Benchmarking constraint instances using KR tools, and vice-versa</li>
          <li>Adapting KR benchmark generation methods to create new CP datasets, and vice-versa</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Important Dates</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Submission of title and abstract:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="May 21, 2025">May 21, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Paper submission deadline:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="May 28, 2025">May 28, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Author response period:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="July 8, 2025">July 2-8, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Notification of acceptance:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="July 16, 2025">July 16, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Camera-ready due:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="August 15, 2025">August 15, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Conference dates:</strong> <span class="date" date-value="November 17, 2025">November 11-17, 2025</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <p>Similarly as for the KR 2025 Main Track, submissions should be anonymous and will be subject to double-blind peer review. Contributions may be <strong>regular papers (up to 9 pages)</strong> or <strong>short papers (up to 4 pages)</strong>, including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">using the style files provided here</a>.</p>
      
        <p>Submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed by PC members on the basis of the overall quality of their technical contribution, with special attention to the suitability of submissions in terms of the scope of the KR and Constraints Track. Authors are recommended to make, as applicable, any relevant data and implementation code available to allow other researchers to reproduce the reported results.</p>

        <p>Authors of papers <strong>may submit a separate PDF or ZIP file with additional information</strong> supporting their claims (such as proof details, additional experimental results, further details on experimental design, etc). The ZIP file may include content such as PDFs, code, or data. Such supplementary material should be submitted via the conference management system. <strong>The paper must be self contained, as the supplementary material will not be published</strong>. Reviewers will have the option, but not the obligation, to consult the supplementary material.</p>
      
        <p>Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. <strong>At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work</strong>.</p>
      
        <p>Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025</a>. Please select the respective track.</p>
      
        <p>Selected authors will be given the option to showcase their work in the Demo Track alongside their regular presentation slot in a session of the track.</p>
      
        <h2>Selection Process</h2>
        <p>The submissions will be selected based on excellent scientific quality, potential impact, correctness, novelty, originality, significance of results, clarity, and quality of the presentation.</p>
      
        <p>Additionally, track-relevant criteria will be considered. This includes the use of or integration with constraint programming systems; quality of empirical evaluation; and availability of resources (data, benchmarks, implementation, etc).</p>
      
        <h2>Inquiries</h2>
        <p>Inquiries should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:kr2025-constraints@easychair.org">kr2025-constraints@easychair.org</a> and will be handled by the KR and Constraints Track chairs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Marco Maratea</strong>, University of Calabria, Italy</li>
          <li><strong>Hélène Verhaeghe</strong>, UCLouvain, Belgium</li>
