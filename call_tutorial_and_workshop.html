        <h1>Call for Tutorial and Workshop Proposals</h1>

        <p>The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2025) solicits proposals for its tutorial and workshop program. Tutorials and workshops will be held on 11th to 13th of November 2025, prior to the KR main technical program. KR will take place physically in Melbourne, Australia. The attendance of tutorials is complementary to all KR registered participants. Workshop attendance will be subject to payment of a workshop fee, which is separate from that of the main conference.</p>

        <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
        <p>Each proposal (tutorial or workshop) should be in English and must be submitted electronically to the Workshop and Tutorial track of KR 2025. For all accepted proposals, KR will take care of all local arrangements. Proposals should be submitted via <a href="https://forms.gle/wovCRPSfCUdugjRSA">this form</a> until March 24, 2025 (anywhere on earth).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Submission form: <a href="https://forms.gle/wovCRPSfCUdugjRSA">https://forms.gle/wovCRPSfCUdugjRSA</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission Requirements for Tutorial Proposals</h2>
        <p>KR tutorials are half-day or (exceptionally) full-day events that introduce general or special topics in KR and relevant neighboring areas. They can be first introductions to an established area or an emerging field, but also advanced courses on specialized methods or new approaches. The content should be adequately established and balanced, and not be limited to advertising an individual research work or product. A focus on specific tools and methodologies can still be useful to offer concrete examples and hands-on activities to participants.</p>

        <p>Each accepted tutorial will entitle a discount on the KR registration fee for one tutorial presenter.</p>

        <p>Each tutorial proposal (of max. 4 pages) should contain the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title, presenters, and proposed length of the tutorial (half-day is recommended, but an argument can be made for a full-day tutorial)</li>
            <li>A half-page introduction to the tutorial's subject and relevance to KR</li>
            <li>A half-page on the target audience, prerequisite knowledge, and learning goals</li>
            <li>One-page outline of the tutorial contents and intended structure</li>
            <li>A brief resume of each presenter including name, affiliation, email address, and evidence of scholarship in the area, mentioning relevant publications or professional experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main duties of tutorial organizers:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup a webpage for the tutorial, which should at least include the information from the proposal, tutorial material, and related references.</li>
            <li>Deliver the tutorial at KR 2025. Tutorials will be in person, at least one tutorial organizer is expected to be present.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission Requirements for Workshop Proposals</h2>
        <p>Workshops provide a place to exchange ideas in emerging fields in KR research and application. They can take many forms, including mini-conferences (with peer-reviewed publications), competitions and shared tasks, working sessions (discussions, hackathons, etc.), line-ups of invited contributions, or a mix of these. Innovative formats are welcome, but organizers must provide means of estimating attendance and required length up-front (by number of submissions, invited speakers, or early registered participants).</p>

        <p>Workshop proposals can use up to 4 pages, which should include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title, acronym of the workshop, proposed duration (half-day, one-day, etc.)</li>
            <li>Workshop description: goals, format, and expected activities during the workshop</li>
            <li>Audience: target audience, research groups in the area, planned or confirmed invited speakers, expected number of submissions and participants</li>
            <li>Related events: history of the workshop (if applicable), relationship to recent similar events</li>
            <li>Tentative list of PC members with their respective affiliations</li>
            <li>A brief resume of each organizer including name, affiliation, contact details, and evidence of scholarship in the area, mentioning relevant publications or professional experience.</li>
            <li>Appendix: tentative call for contributions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Main duties of the chair(s) of each accepted workshop:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up a webpage for the workshop</li>
            <li>Advertise the workshop, distribute its call for papers and call for participation</li>
            <li>Coordinate the peer-reviewing of submitted contributions</li>
            <li>If workshop proceedings are desired, it is the duty of the organizers to produce and distribute their workshop proceedings</li>
            <li>Organize a schedule for the workshop in collaboration with the local organizers and the KR workshop co-chairs</li>
            <li>Coordinate and moderate the workshop participation and content</li>
            <li>Deliver the workshop at KR 2025. Workshops will be in person, at least one tutorial organizer is expected to be present.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>KR reserves the right to cancel a workshop if it does not have enough participants to cover its running costs.</strong></p>
