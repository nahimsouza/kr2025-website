        <h1>Call for Videos for the KR 2025 Video Track</h1>

        <p>Following the success of the first edition of KR's video track, we are excited to launch its second edition, which will be held at the 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2025). The call for submissions is now open!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boost KR's reach:</strong> Help researchers share their work in ways that a wider public can enjoy and understand.</li>
          <li><strong>Spotlight interesting applications and insights:</strong> Give KR work a stage, whether it's breakthroughs for science, industry, or just curious minds!</li>
          <li><strong>Sharpen your science communication skills:</strong> Challenge your ability to explain complex KR concepts with clarity, creativity, and confidence, whether to experts or a general audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Two videos will receive special recognition: the <strong>Best Video Award</strong> (selected by the PC) and the <strong>Public Choice Award</strong> (decided by KR 2025 participants). The winners will be announced at the KR 2025 conference. All accepted videos will be published on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@krconferenceseries9472" target="_blank">KR Conference YouTube channel</a>.</p>
