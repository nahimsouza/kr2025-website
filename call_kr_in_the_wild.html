        <h1>Call for Papers: KR in the Wild</h1>

        <p>As a complement to the traditional KR Main track focusing more on theoretical advances in KR, the <strong>KR in the Wild</strong> track aims to showcase <strong>successful deployments of KR formalisms</strong> in <strong>all types of application domains</strong> as well as <strong>recent developments in the state-of-the-art in automated reasoning systems</strong> which form the basis for successful deployment of declarative problem solving in an ever-increasing number of practical settings.</p>

        <p>Towards these goals, the KR in the Wild Track welcomes contributions from areas that are sometimes considered as not core KR research. This includes (but is not restricted to) <strong>state-of-the-art reasoning systems and solvers</strong> developed in the various vibrant declarative programming communities as well as insightful applications of such systems. As further goals, the track aims to <strong>foster interactions</strong> between <strong>practical and theoretical advances</strong>, and to encourage the discussion of new ideas, research experiences, emerging results and open challenges that can inspire novel research directions and influence the future of KR research.</p>

        <h2>Expected Contributions</h2>
        <p>We invite submissions of papers on all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of KR tools and techniques to solve application problems, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>System descriptions</strong> including the description of algorithmic techniques, heuristics and optimizations for established systems;</li>
            <li><strong>Case studies</strong>, including descriptions of the problem setting, data and tools used, and "lessons learned";</li>
            <li><strong>Assessments</strong> and reports of experimental studies, rigorously assessing aspects such as scalability, usability, acceptance and uptake;</li>
            <li><strong>Benchmarks and resources</strong> that may support the assessment of KR tools, such as data sets, collections of problems with "solution sets" or gold standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Dates</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Submission of title and abstract:</strong> May 21, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Paper submission deadline:</strong> May 28, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Author response period:</strong> July 2-8, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Notification of acceptance:</strong> July 16, 2025</li>
          <li><strong>Conference dates:</strong> November 11-17, 2025</li>
        </ul>
      

        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Evaluation Criteria</h2>
        <p>Similarly as for the KR 2025 Main Track, submissions should be anonymous and will be subject to double-blind peer review. Contributions may be <strong>regular papers (up to 9 pages)</strong> or <strong>short papers (up to 4 pages)</strong>, including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">using the style files provided here</a>.

        <p>Submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed by PC members on the basis of the overall quality of their technical contribution, with special attention to the suitability of submissions in terms of the scope of the KR in the Wild Track. Due to the applied nature of the KR In the Wild Track, authors are recommended to make, as applicable, any relevant data and implementation code available to allow other researchers to reproduce the reported results.</p>

        <p>Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work.</p>

        <h2>Selection Process</h2>
        <p>The submissions will be selected based on the excellent scientific quality, potential impact, correctness, novelty, originality, significance of results, clarity, and quality of the presentation.</p>

        <p>Additionally, track-relevant criteria will be considered. This includes the impact and novelty of the application setting or system presented; quality of empirical evaluation; and availability of resources (data, benchmarks, implementation, etc).</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mutsunori Banbara</strong>, Nagoya University</li>
            <li><strong>Sarah Gaggl</strong>, TU Dresden</li>
        </ul>
