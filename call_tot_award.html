        <h1>KR Test of Time Award: Call for Nominations</h1>
    
        <p>The aim of the KR Test of Time Award is to recognize papers published at the KR conference whose contributions have made a significant and lasting impact on the KRR academic discipline and/or the application or adoption of KRR techniques in industry and/or for the betterment of society.</p>
        
        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Eligible papers are those that have been published at the KR conference at least 15 years ago.</p>
        
        <h2>Nominations</h2>
        <p>While papers do not need to be nominated to receive the award, the Awards committee welcomes suggestions from KRR researchers of papers that they believe merit consideration for the Test of Time award.</p>
        <p>A single person may nominate more than one paper. Self-nominations are not allowed. By default, nominations will be kept and may be used to inform future Awards committees.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Submit Nominations</h2>
        <p>Nominations should be submitted via EasyChair (select the "KR Test of Time Award" track): <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=kr2025">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=kr2025</a></p>
        <p>The title of the nominated paper should be put in the Title field, and the list of authors and year of publication at KR should be provided in the Abstract box. Any text can be added to the Keywords box. A single PDF file (extension .pdf) should be uploaded with a short text (1-2 paragraphs) explaining why the paper merits the award.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you wish to nominate a paper that has an Award committee member as an author, please submit your nomination by email to a committee member not having a conflict and/or to the KR Inc. President (Gabriele Kern-Isberner).</p>
