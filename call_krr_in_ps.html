        <h1>Call for Papers: KR&amp;R in Planning &amp; Scheduling</h1>

        <p>The track on <strong>Knowledge Representation &amp; Reasoning in Planning &amp; Scheduling (KR&amp;R in P&amp;S)</strong> emphasizes the <strong>synergistic interactions between the two areas</strong>, and welcomes contributions that extend the state of the art at their intersection.</p>

        <h2>Expected Contributions</h2>

        <p>We welcome papers that investigate the synergy between knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms and methods, and planning languages and methods, such as (but not limited to):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge representation languages for non-classical planning</li>
          <li>Relations between action languages and planning languages</li>
          <li>Representation of actions and change, background knowledge, and planning heuristics</li>
          <li>Automated reformulations/revisions of action domain descriptions</li>
          <li>Reasoning for plan computation, synthesis, analysis, verification, reuse and repairs</li>
          <li>Orchestration of planning with other reasoning methods for plan execution monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ICAPS Resubmissions</h2>

        <p>For resubmissions of ICAPS papers we ask the authors to provide the original submission, ICAPS reviews and, optionally, a summary of changes. The reviewers will only see the ICAPS reviews after they submit their own.</p>

        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Evaluation Criteria</h2>

        <p>Submissions must be anonymous and will be subject to double-blind peer review. Contributions may be <strong>regular papers (up to 9 pages)</strong> or <strong>short papers (up to 4 pages)</strong>, including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements. Papers must be written in English and formatted <a href="files/KR25_authors_kit.zip">using the style files provided here</a>.</p>

        <p>Submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed by PC members on the basis of the overall quality of their technical contribution, with special attention to the suitability of submissions in terms of the scope of the KR&amp;R in P&amp;S Track. Authors are recommended to make, as applicable, any relevant data and implementation code available to allow other researchers to reproduce the reported results.</p>

        <p>Authors of papers <strong>may submit a separate PDF or ZIP file with additional information</strong> supporting their claims (such as proof details, additional experimental results, further details on experimental design, etc). The ZIP file may include content such as PDFs, code, or data. Such supplementary material should be submitted via the conference management system. <strong>The paper must be self contained, as the supplementary material will not be published</strong>. Reviewers will have the option, but not the obligation, to consult the supplementary material.</p>

        <p>Accepted papers will be published in the KR 2025 proceedings. <strong>At least one author of each accepted paper is required to participate in the conference and present the work</strong>.</p>

        <p>Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2025</a>. Please select the respective track.</p>

        <h2>Selection Process</h2>

        <p>The submissions will be selected based on the excellent scientific quality, potential impact, correctness, novelty, originality, significance of results, clarity, and quality of the presentation.</p>

        <p>Additionally, track-relevant criteria will be considered, including impact, novelty and relevance to both areas.</p>

        <h2>Inquiries</h2>

        <p>Inquiries should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:patrizi@diag.uniroma1.it">patrizi@diag.uniroma1.it</a> and <a href="mailto:natasha.alechina@ou.nl">natasha.alechina@ou.nl</a> and will be handled by the KR&amp;R and P&amp;S Track chairs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fabio Patrizi</strong>, Sapienza University of Rome</li>
          <li><strong>Natasha Alechina</strong>, Open Universiteit / Utrecht University</li>
